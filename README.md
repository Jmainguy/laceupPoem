# Poem for Lace up Challenge

```
if we make it easy to use
    then users will show up
fi
```

```
try
    to understand their needs
except
    for when they dont know themselves
finally
    come together and build something awesome
```


```
for ease of use in technology
    is something we should all strive for.
```

```
// write maintainable code and 
raise exceptions when things break
```

```
run kubernetes
current state, desired state
it has reconciled
```
